    <h1>Autism spectrum</h1>
    <p>
      Autism, formally called autism spectrum disorder (ASD) or autism spectrum
      condition (ASC),is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by deficits
      in social communication and social interaction, and repetitive or
      restricted patterns of behaviors, interests, or activities, which can
      include hyper- and hyporeactivity to sensory input. Autism is a spectrum
      disorder, meaning that it can manifest very differently in each person.
      For example, some are nonspeaking, while others have proficient spoken
      language. Because of this, there is wide variation in the support needs of
      people across the autism spectrum. There are many theories about what
      causes autism; it is highly heritable and mainly genetic, but many genes
      are involved, and environmental factors may also be relevant. The syndrome
      frequently co-occurs with other conditions, including attention deficit
      hyperactivity disorder, epilepsy, and intellectual disability.
      Disagreements persist about what should be included as part of the
      diagnosis, whether there are meaningful subtypes of autism, and the
      significance of autism-associated traits in the wider population. The
      combination of broader criteria, increased awareness, and potentially
      increasing actual prevalence, has led to a trend of steadily increasing
      estimates of autism prevalence, perpetuating the myth that it is caused by
      vaccines.Psychiatry has traditionally classified autism as a mental
      disorder, and the autism rights movement and a small but increasing number
      of researchers see autism as part of neurodiversity, the natural diversity
      in human thinking and experience, with strengths, differences, and
      weaknesses. From this point of view, autistic people often still have a
      disability, but need to be accommodated rather than cured. This
      perspective has led to significant controversy among those who are
      autistic and advocates, practitioners, and charities.Some therapies for
      autism, such as applied behavior analysis, are controversial in the autism
      rights movement, with many considering them unhelpful and unethical. There
      is no known way to prevent or cure autism. Many forms of therapy, such as
      speech and occupational therapy, have been developed that may help
      autistic people. Some forms of therapy, such as applied behavior analysis,
      have been shown to improve certain symptoms of autism, such as
      socialization, communication, expressive language, intellectual
      functioning, language development, and acquisition of daily living skills.
      Intervention can require accommodations such as alternative modes of
      communication. The use of pharmaceutical medicine is usually focused on
      associated conditions such as epilepsy or certain symptoms. Research
      indicates that autistic people are substantially more likely to be LGBT
      than the general population. They are also significantly more likely to be
      non-theistic
